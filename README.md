## **How It Works**

### **1. Course Materials**
- Students can view course materials (PDFs) for their enrolled department.
- The CourseList.jsx component displays a list of courses with a "View PDF" button.
- The `PdfViewer.jsx` component is used to display the selected PDF.

### **2. Randomized Tests**
- Students can start a test by clicking the "Start Test" button on the `CoursePage.jsx`.
- The `TestPage.jsx` fetches random questions from the `questionService.jsx` and displays them one by one.
- A timer (`Timer.jsx`) tracks the time taken for the test.
- At the end of the test, the score is calculated and displayed.

### **3. Admin Management**
- Admins can manage departments and courses using the `AdminDashboard.jsx`.
- The CourseList.jsx allows admins to add, edit, and delete courses.
- The `TrackStudentProgress.jsx` provides insights into student progress.
