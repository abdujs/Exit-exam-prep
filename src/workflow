E-Learning Web App Workflow
1️⃣ Authentication & Role Check
Users log in using Firebase Authentication.
Firestore verifies their role (admin or student).
Redirect based on role:
Admin → Admin Dashboard
Student → Student Dashboard

2️⃣ Admin Dashboard Workflow
Manage Departments

Add, Edit, or Delete departments.
Each department includes multiple courses.
Manage Courses

Add courses with Title, Description, and PDF Content.
PDF files are uploaded to Firebase Storage, and the URL is stored in Firestore.
Admin can Edit or Delete courses.
Track Student Progress

Admin views enrolled students and their progress (% completed).

<!-- Admin Login

Admins log in using their credentials via Firebase Authentication.
Upon successful login, Firestore verifies the admin role.
Admins are redirected to the Admin Dashboard. -->

3️⃣ Student Dashboard Workflow
View Available Departments

Students browse available departments.
Clicking “Enroll” registers the student to the department and auto-enrolls them in related courses.
Access Course Content

Students can view or download PDFs.
Track Progress (Checklist)

Each course includes a checklist for marking progress.
Attempt Quizzes (Optional)

Students attempt simple multiple-choice quizzes.
Scores are calculated and saved in Firestore.

4️⃣ Database Structure
Users → Stores user info, roles, and enrollments.
Departments → Contains department details and course references.
Courses → Stores course details, descriptions, and PDF URLs.
Progress → Tracks each student's course completion status.
Quizzes → Contains quiz questions, answers, and scores.


1. Overview of the Workflow
Student Triggers Question Generation:

student  clicks the "start" button for a department in the ManageDepartments component.
The system fetches all courses in the department and extracts their PDF URLs.
These URLs are sent to the AI service (aiService) to generate 100 multiple-choice questions.
AI Service Generates Questions:

The aiService sends the PDF URLs to an external AI API (e.g., OpenAI, custom-trained model, etc.).
The API processes the PDFs and returns 100 questions with 4 choices each and the correct answer.
Questions are Saved:

The generated questions are saved in Firestore under the department's quizzes subcollection for future use.
Students Take the Quiz:

Students can start the quiz for their enrolled department in the StudentDashboard.
The quiz is displayed one question at a time using the QuizDisplay component, with navigation (Next/Previous) and a timer.
At the end, students submit their answers, and the system calculates their score.

Here’s how the AI question generation feature works and how you can implement it step by step:

---

### **1. Overview of the Workflow**
1. **Admin Triggers Question Generation**:
   - Admin clicks the "Generate Questions" button for a department in the `ManageDepartments` component.
   - The system fetches all courses in the department and extracts their PDF URLs.
   - These URLs are sent to the AI service (`aiService`) to generate 100 multiple-choice questions.

2. **AI Service Generates Questions**:
   - The `aiService` sends the PDF URLs to an external AI API (e.g., OpenAI, custom-trained model, etc.).
   - The API processes the PDFs and returns 100 questions with 4 choices each and the correct answer.

3. **Questions are Saved**:
   - The generated questions are saved in Firestore under the department's `quizzes` subcollection for future use.

4. **Students Take the Quiz**:
   - Students can start the quiz for their enrolled department in the `StudentDashboard`.
   - The quiz is displayed one question at a time using the `QuizDisplay` component, with navigation (Next/Previous) and a timer.
   - At the end, students submit their answers, and the system calculates their score.

---

### **2. Implementation Steps**

#### **Step 1: AI Service**
- The `aiService.jsx` file handles communication with the AI API.
- The `generateQuestions` function sends the PDF URLs to the API and retrieves the generated questions.

#### **Step 2: Admin Dashboard**
- In the `ManageDepartments` component:
  - Add a "Generate Questions" button for each department.
  - When clicked, fetch all courses in the department using `getCoursesByDepartment`.
  - Extract the `fileURL` of each course and pass them to the `generateQuestions` function.
  - Save the generated questions in Firestore using the `saveGeneratedQuestions` function in `quizService`.

#### **Step 3: Student Dashboard**
- In the `StudentDashboard` component:
  - Add a "Start Quiz" button for each enrolled department.
  - When clicked, fetch the questions from Firestore for the department.
  - Pass the questions to the `QuizDisplay` component for rendering.

#### **Step 4: Quiz Display**
- The `QuizDisplay` component:
  - Displays one question at a time with 4 choices.
  - Tracks the student's answers and time left.
  - Submits the answers and calculates the score at the end.

---

### **3. How the Components Work Together**

#### **Admin Workflow**
1. Admin navigates to the `ManageDepartments` component.
2. Admin clicks "Generate Questions" for a department.
3. The system:
   - Fetches all courses in the department.
   - Sends their PDF URLs to the AI API.
   - Saves the generated questions in Firestore.

#### **Student Workflow**
1. Student navigates to the `StudentDashboard`.
2. Student clicks "Start Quiz" for an enrolled department.
3. The system:
   - Fetches the questions from Firestore.
   - Displays the quiz using the `QuizDisplay` component.
4. Student answers the questions and submits the quiz.
5. The system calculates the score and displays the result.

---

### **4. External AI API**
- You need an AI API capable of processing PDF content and generating questions.
- Example APIs:
  - **OpenAI GPT**: Use the `text-davinci` or `gpt-4` model to process text and generate questions.
  - **Custom AI Model**: Train a model on your course materials for better accuracy.
- The API should accept:
  - PDF URLs.
  - Number of questions to generate.
- The API should return:
  - A list of questions, each with 4 choices and the correct answer.

---

### **5. Example AI API Request**
Here’s an example of how the `generateQuestions` function sends a request to the AI API:

```javascript
const response = await axios.post('https://your-ai-api-endpoint.com/generate-questions', {
  pdfUrls: ['https://example.com/course1.pdf', 'https://example.com/course2.pdf'],
  questionCount: 100,
});
```

The API should return a response like this:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the capital of France?",
      "choices": ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
      "correctAnswer": "Paris"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 2 + 2?",
      "choices": ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
      "correctAnswer": "4"
    }
    // ...98 more questions
  ]
}
```

---

### **6. Firestore Structure**
- Save the generated questions in Firestore under the department's `quizzes` subcollection:
  ```
  departments
    └── departmentId
        └── quizzes
            └── quizId
                ├── questions: [Array of 100 questions]
                ├── createdAt: Timestamp
  ```

---

### **7. Testing**
- Test the AI question generation with sample PDFs.
- Verify that the questions are saved in Firestore.
- Ensure the quiz displays correctly in the `QuizDisplay` component.
- Validate the scoring logic after submission.
